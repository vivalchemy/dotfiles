# üñ•Ô∏è Dotfiles and System Setup with Ansible  

This repository contains my personal system configuration managed using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). The configurations and dotfiles are designed specifically for **Arch Linux** and aim to provide a modular, automated setup for a consistent and efficient development environment.

## ‚ú® Features  
- **Automated System Configuration:** Configure tools like `neovim`, `tmux`, `zsh`, and more.  
- **Symlinking Dotfiles:** Dotfiles are symlinked rather than copied for easier updates.  
- **Tag-Based Role Management:** Organize roles for different environments using tags.  
- **Customizable Execution with Extra Vars**: Control the behavior of the playbook with the `configure` and `update` extra variables, allowing you to skip symlink creation or perform updates as needed.

Run specific tags with:  
```bash  
ansible-playbook main.yaml --ask-become-pass --tags "<comma-seperated-tag-names>"
```
> **Note:**  
> When passing tags via the CLI (e.g., `--tags`), the specified tags have a union-like effect.  
> This means tasks or roles will be executed if they match **any** of the given tags. For example:  
> 
> ```bash
> ansible-playbook main.yaml --tags "cli,gui"
> ```
> 
> In this case, all tasks associated with either the `cli` or `gui` tags will be executed.

## üîå Extra Arguments
You can pass additional arguments to customize the behavior of the Ansible playbook. The two main arguments are `configure` and `update`. These options allow you to control symlink creation and application updates during the execution of the playbook.

| **Arg**       | **Available Values** | **Description**                                                                                                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `configure`   | `true` (default), `false`      | `true`: Creates symlinks for config, data, etc., ensuring the application uses your specified configurations.<br>`false`: Skips creating symlinks, leaving existing configurations unchanged. |
| `update`      | `true` (default), `false`      | `true`: Updates the application/role to the latest version.<br>`false`: Skips the update process, keeping the current version as-is. |

### Usage Example

To run the playbook with custom arguments, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook main.yaml --tags "cli" --extra-vars "configure=false update=true"
```

This command will run the playbook with the `cli` tag, skip symlink creation (by setting `configure=false`), and ensure that the applications are updated (by setting `update=true`).

## ‚úÖ TODOs  
- [ ] Add `zen userChrome.css` configuration.  
- [ ] Add an extra args called debug to turn on debug mode 
- [ ] Install additional fonts.  
- [ ] Install remaining aur and non config packages via Ansible.
